            <h1>Cultural Significance of Golden Eagle</h1>
            <p>
                The golden eagle holds deep cultural significance across various cultures. In Indigenous American
                traditions, eagles are sacred symbols of strength, courage, wisdom, respect, and honor, believed to have
                a divine connection and central to spiritual ceremonies. For the Aztecs, the golden eagle represented
                the Sun, served as a noble symbol and a messenger of the god Huitzilopochtli, and even functioned as
                currency for tribute payments. In Mongolia, eagle hunting is a revered tradition, with hunters
                showcasing their skills in competitions. Additionally, the golden eagle has a long history in falconry,
                honored in various ancient cultures. In the U.S., the Fish and Wildlife Service’s National Eagle
                Repository supplies eagle feathers to Native Americans for religious and cultural practices.

                <h1>Unique Thing About Golden Eagles</h1>
                <p> Golden eagles have remarkable eyesight that allows them to spot prey from over two miles away. Their
                    vision is about eight times sharper than a human's, enabling them to detect even the slightest
                    movement on the ground while soaring high above. This incredible eyesight, combined with speeds of
                    up to 200 mph during a dive, makes them one of the most skilled hunters in the bird world.
